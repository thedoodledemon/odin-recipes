        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

        <p>This is like a creamy, cheesy, full-of-flavor-in-every-bite dish. 
            The chicken is tender and moist and the tortillas are soft. 
            The enchilada sauce is tangy and pungent and complements the 
            creamy, rich filling so well. This is also great for entertaining 
            because it can be fully assembled ahead of time or even frozen and 
            cooked later. Serve with toppings such as salsa, sour cream, avocado, 
            cilantro, and jalapenos.</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 1/4 pounds skinless,boneless chicken breast halves</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons chili powder, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin, divided </li>
                <li>12 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium poblano pepper, seeded and chopped</li>
            </ul>
        
        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place chicken on a large sheet of foil and season 
                    with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon chili powder, 
                    and 1/2 teaspoon cumin. Seal the foil around the 
                    chicken and place the packet on a rimmed baking 
                    sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until tender and no 
                    longer pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An 
                    instant-read thermometer inserted into the center 
                    should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). 
                    Shred cooked chicken and set aside. Increase the oven 
                    temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>While chicken cooks, prepare tortillas. Spread 
                    both sides of each tortilla lightly with butter. 
                    Heat a skillet over medium heat. Toast each tortilla, 
                    about 10 seconds on each side, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high 
                    heat. Add onion, poblano pepper, and bell pepper 
                    and cook, stirring often, about 2 minutes. Add 
                    remaining salt, chili powder, and cumin and cook, 
                    stirring frequently, until veggies are very tender,
                    about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir
                    in tomatoes and cream cheese. Cook, stirring constantly, 
                    until cheese has melted. Remove from heat and stir in sour 
                    cream and 2 cups Cheddar-Monterey Jack cheese blend.</li>
                <li>Spread about 1 tablespoon refried beans, if using, 
                    in the center of a tortilla. Add about 1/4 cup chicken 
                    filling and roll up to seal. Repeat with remaining beans 
                    and filling. Pour 1/4 cup sauce in the bottom of 9x13-inch 
                    baking dish. Arrange enchiladas in a single layer over 
                    the sauce. Pour remaining enchilada sauce over the top and 
                    spread to evenly coat. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, about 
                    30 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving with 
                    desired toppings.</li>
