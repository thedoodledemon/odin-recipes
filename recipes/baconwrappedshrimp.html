        <h1>Bacon Wrapped Shrimp</h1>

        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>

        <p>Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients, 
            but big on flavor! I like to use "extra jumbo" 
            size shrimp, which are 16-20 per pound. Cutting 
            the bacon lengthwise into narrow strips makes it 
            easier to wrap. Refrigerating the shrimp, as well 
            as using thin-cut bacon, will prevent the shrimp 
            from overcooking in the time it takes to crisp the 
            bacon.</p>

        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

            <ul>
                <li>16 jumbo Shrimp, fresh, raw, jumbo (11-15)</li>
                <li>Â¾ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
                <li>8 strips thin sliced bacon, cut in half</li>
                <li>16 toothpicks</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons hot honey </li>
            </ul>

        <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>

            <ol>
                <li>Place shrimp on a plate and sprinkle both sides 
                    with Cajun seasoning. Wrap each shrimp with 1 narrow 
                    strip of bacon and fasten with a toothpick. Refrigerate 
                    for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Air-fry shrimp for 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking 
                    until bacon is lightly crispy, 4 to 5 minutes more. 
                    You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of 
                    your air fryer.</li>
                <li>Remove shrimp to a plate and drizzle with hot honey. 
                    Serve immediately, being watchful of any toothpicks.</li>
